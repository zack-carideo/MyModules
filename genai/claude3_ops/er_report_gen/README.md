# CLAUDE BASED FINANCIAL CONTROL GENERATION  

## Overview
This folder contains a set of Python scripts designed to process and analyze data for generating reports. Below is a brief description of each script:

- **source_data.py**: This script is responsible for sourcing and preparing the initial data required for the report generation process.
- **id_risks_from_report.py**: This script identifies potential risks from the sourced data and prepares them for further analysis.
- **gen_control_test_procs.py**: This script generates control test procedures based on the identified risks and prepares the final report.

Each script plays a crucial role in the overall workflow, ensuring that data is accurately sourced, risks are identified, and appropriate control tests are generated.
